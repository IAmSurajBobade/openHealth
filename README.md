# Open Health

Simple and easy to use health records management platform. accessible at [https://open-health-gamma.vercel.app](https://open-health-gamma.vercel.app)

## Problem

- Managing multiple health conditions and records for all family members is complex and time consuming
- Difficult to connect the data between different doctors and hospitals
- No single source of truth for all health records
- No visibility across all conditions
- No way to see and understand the test record patterns [change in bp, sugar levels, etc.]
